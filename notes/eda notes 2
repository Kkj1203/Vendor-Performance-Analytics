Previously, we examined the various tables in the database to identify key variables, understand their relationships, and determine which ones should be included in the final analysis.
In this phase of EDA, we will analyze the resultant table to gain insights into the distribution of each column. This will help us understand data patterns, identify anomalies, and ensure data quality before proceeding with further analysis.



Summary Statistics Insights:

Negative & Zero Values:
Gross Profit: Minimum value is -52,002.78, indicating losses. Some products or transactions may be selling at a loss due to high costs or selling at discounts lower than the purchase price.
Profit Margin: Has a minimum of -∞, which suggests cases where revenue is zero or even lower than costs.
Total Sales Quantity & Sales Dollars: Minimum values are 0, meaning some products were purchased but never sold. These could be slow-moving or obsolete stock.

Outliers Indicated by High Standard Deviations:
Purchase & Actual Prices: The max values (5,681.81 & 7,499.99) are significantly higher than the mean (24.39 & 35.64), indicating potential premium products.
Freight Cost: Huge variation, from 0.09 to 257,032.07, suggests logistics inefficiencies or bulk shipments.
Stock Turnover: Ranges from 0 to 274.5, implying some products sell extremely fast while others remain in stock indefinitely. Value more than 1 indicates that Sold quantity for that product is higher than purchased quantity due to either sales are being fulfilled from older stock.



Correlation Insights

PurchasePrice has weak correlations with TotalSalesDollars (-0.012) and GrossProfit (-0.016), suggesting that price variations do not significantly impact sales revenue or profit.
Strong correlation between total purchase quantity and total sales quantity (0.999), confirming efficient inventory turnover.
Negative correlation between profit margin & total sales price (-0.179) suggests that as sales price increases, margins decrease, possibly due to competitive pricing pressures.
StockTurnover has weak negative correlations with both GrossProfit (-0.038) and ProfitMargin (-0.055), indicating that faster turnover does not necessarily result in higher profitability.
