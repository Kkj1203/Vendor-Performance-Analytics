• The purchases table contains actual purchase data, including the date of purchase, products (brands) purchased by vendors, the amount paid (in dollars), and the quantity purchased.
• The purchase price column is derived from the purchase_prices table, which provides product-wise actual and purchase prices. The combination of vendor and brand is unique in this table.
• The vendor_invoice table aggregates data from the purchases table, summarizing quantity and dollar amounts, along with an additional column for freight. This table maintains uniqueness based on vendor and PO number.
• The sales table captures actual sales transactions, detailing the brands purchased by vendors, the quantity sold, the selling price, and the revenue earned.

As the data that we need for analysis is distributed in different tables, we need to create a summary table containing:
• purchase transactions made by vendors
• sales transaction data
• freight costs for each vendor
• actual product prices from vendors

The query generates a vendor-wise sales and purchase summary, which is valuable for:
Performance Optimization:
- The query involves heavy joins and aggregations on large datasets like sales and purchases.
- Storing the pre-aggregated results avoids repeated expensive computations.
- Helps in analyzing sales, purchases, and pricing for different vendors and brands.
- Future Benefits of Storing this data for faster Dashboarding & Reporting.
- Instead of running expensive queries each time, dashboards can fetch data quickly from vendor_sales_summary.

• Vendors buying in bulk (Large Order Size) get the lowest unit price ($10.78 per unit), meaning higher margins if they can manage inventory efficiently.
• The price difference between Small and Large orders is substantial (~72% reduction in unit cost).
• This suggests that bulk pricing strategies successfully encourage vendors to purchase in larger volumes, leading to higher overall sales despite lower per-unit revenue.

• The confidence interval for low-performing vendors (40.48% to 42.62%) is significantly higher than that of top-performing vendors (30.74% to 31.61%).
• This suggests that vendors with lower sales tend to maintain higher profit margins, potentially due to premium pricing or lower operational costs.
• For High-Performing Vendors: If they aim to improve profitability, they could explore selective price adjustments, cost optimization, or bundling strategies.
• For Low-Performing Vendors: Despite higher margins, their low sales volume might indicate a need for better marketing, competitive pricing, or improved distribution strategies.
